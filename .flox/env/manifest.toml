# Scripts defined in the `[profile]` section are *sourced* by *your shell* and
# inherit environment variables set in the `[vars]` section and by `[hook]` scripts.
# The `profile.common` script is sourced by all shells and special care should be
# taken to ensure compatibility with all shells, after which exactly one of
# `profile.{bash,fish,tcsh,zsh}` is sourced by the corresponding shell.

# The `[services]` section of the manifest allows you to define services.
# Services defined here use the packages provided by the `[install]` section
# and any variables you've defined in the `[vars]` section or `hook.on-activate` script.
